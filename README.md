# Sports Predictive Analytics Project
This project aims to enhance predictive analytics in sports using the Random Forest algorithm. By training a model on comprehensive game statistics, we can forecast game outcomes and improve strategic decision-making for team composition and game strategies.

Project Components
Data Collection:
Fetching historical game data, team rosters, and team statistics from ESPN.

Data Preprocessing:
Converting raw game data into a structured format suitable for analysis.

Feature Engineering:
Creating relevant features from the game data.

Model Training with Random Forest:
Using the Random Forest algorithm to train a model on the preprocessed game data.
Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Analyzing feature importance to understand key factors influencing game outcomes.

Command-Line Interface:
Fetching teams, rosters, and game data.
Displaying predictions and model performance metrics.
